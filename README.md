# Azure Health App by Azure Rose Team

We made and developed an app that tracks our daily diet with a feature where the users can identify calories of each
food so we can choose our food diet wisely through an image processing.

The main purpose of this app that we made is to help people decrease or maintain their weight while the pandemic of
covid-19 made obesity itself is reported to be one of the risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 infection. Moreover,
due to lockdown or self-isolation, make people rely on processed and instant foods that have high calorie.

So, our app ensuring people to choose their foods calorie intake carefully.
